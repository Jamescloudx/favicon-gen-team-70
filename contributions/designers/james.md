2. i made sure that other designers were following the style guide i created, it was really tasking because some folks still went on to be using fonts that i have not seen before, so i had to start correcting and correcting.
3. my team lead assigned that designers work on the mobile and tablet view which i then created a grid system for it and made other deigners use it, here is the link to the mobile view https://www.figma.com/file/I1wqx5RQj2QeFrTtMq7iYE/mobile_view_draft?node-id=0%3A1 here we have the authenticated users and signed in users.
4. i redesigned the tablet view too so that my fellow designers could follow https://www.figma.com/file/bKjRgfTj5TQw3aE2EFhHlY/tablet_view_daft?node-id=0%3A1 
5. i created the color system for ICON CITY https://www.figma.com/file/z4V75Up3EPjzqG1oSrbrzP/Color_system?node-id=0%3A1
